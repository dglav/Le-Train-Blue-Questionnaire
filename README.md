## ðŸš€ Things I learned

1. **Relating to updating packages with regards to the production build**

It was actually quite hard to get this site to deploy correctly with no bugs on Github Pages.
This is how I first realized that the production build of my site was broken.
I think it's quite important that, whenever doing configuration changes at the root of my project, that all the different builds of it, run correctly.

Also, I think it's quite important to think about what I want to add to my project ahead of time. If I don't think I will need it right away, it's okay to look up how to add it later. Adding things that I'm not sure I'll need just adds complexity and the chances of something unexpected breaking.
